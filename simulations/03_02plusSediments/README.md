#Parameters

* Air temperature **T**
* Total P concentration **TP**
* TP linear reduction **TPR**
* DOC concentration **DOC**

Last three are controlled using runoff input to MyLake. This time
there's no change in MyLake parameters. 

## Levels

Level | Temperature | Total P | TP linear reduction | DOC
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | original - 5 | original | Total P remains | original 
2 | original  | original * 10  | Total P diminishing to 50 % at the end | original * 10
3 | original + 5 | original * 100 | Total P diminishing to 0 % at the end | original * 100
